# Why BRIDGR?

Web3 companies raised $94 billion from 2016 to 2022 but more than 90% will fail. BRIDGR is a collective of Web3 companies offering a unique collaborative platform to accelerate your Web3 growth and help you become a successful business.

We help you overcome the challenges that cause most Web3 companies to fail:

1. No product/market fit
2. Lack of cash / failed to raise new capital
3. Flawed business model
4. Lack of visibility & poor marketing
5. Not the right team
6. Legal problems
