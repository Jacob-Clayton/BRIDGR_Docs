# Access Web3 Focus Groups

## Why might you need a focus group?

### 1. Ensure you have the right product/market fit prior to launch

### 2. Get a good idea of how much your customers will be willing to pay

### 3. Facilitate creativity in areas you may not have thought about

####

So, you’ve developed a great product but you’re not sure how the market will respond to it?

Reduce the risk of commercial failure by leveraging on BRIDGR’s community of seasoned Web3 professionals and enthusiasts for product feedback prior to launch.&#x20;

We deliver product feedback through tailored focus group sessions where BRIDGR:

* Helps you phrase your research questions
* Recruits 6-9 community members matching your customer profiles
* Hosts, moderates & facilitates the session (60-90 minute duration)
* Conducts a follow-up session with your team where we summarise the product feedback

Included in your annual membership:

* Two tailored focus group sessions facilitated by BRIDGR&#x20;

Additional focus group sessions are charged at USD 500 per session.
