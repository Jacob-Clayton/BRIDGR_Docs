# Build a team for your project

## What’s the general idea?

BRIDGR has an extensive network of valuable contacts. The general idea is to make these contacts available to BRIDGR’s Alpha Partners and Core Partners. Available in the sense that BRIDGR’s Alpha Partners and Core Partners should be able to reach out and request for meetings with contacts in a database owned and operated by BRIDGR. For the contacts in the database, this will be a passive source of leads for their respective businesses and offerings.&#x20;

## Who’s the target group?

* BRIDGR’s Alpha Partners and Core Partners will have access to the contact database and meeting request system.

## Who contributes to building this?

* CFJ / MadForNFTs is lead on aggregating contacts&#x20;
* All Alpha Partners should contribute with contacts who have agreed to be in the database and receive meeting requests (do we need a form for the consent?)

## What’s the delivery platform?

* Ideally, the contact database and meeting request system is token gated. We need to ensure that there’s access for partners only.

## Outstanding matters?

* How do we build such a database and meeting request system?&#x20;
  * A: We build a SQL database and a frontend which can filter contacts by expertise/ name/ location. This frontend is Web3 wallet locked on the BRIDGR website. (not sure how to do the meeting request system).
* Are there existing platforms we can use?
* Who builds it?
* How do we pay for it?
