# Access Web3 Focus Groups

## Why might you need a focus group?

### 1. Ensure you have the right product/market fit prior to launch

### 2. Facilitate creativity in areas you may not have thought about

### 3. Get your idea off the ground&#x20;



####

So, you’ve developed a great product but you’re not sure how the market will respond to it?

Reduce the risk of commercial failure by leveraging on BRIDGR’s community of seasoned Web3 professionals and enthusiasts for product feedback prior to launch.&#x20;

We deliver product feedback through tailored focus group sessions where BRIDGR:

* Helps you phrase your research questions
* Recruits 6-9 community members matching your customer profiles
* Hosts, moderates & facilitates the session (60-90 minute duration)
* Conducts a follow-up session with your team where we summarise the product feedback

Included in your annual membership:

* Two tailored focus group sessions facilitated by BRIDGR&#x20;

Additional focus group sessions are charged at USD 500 per session.



## What’s the general idea?

BRIDGR has an extensive network of valuable contacts. The general idea is to make these contacts available to BRIDGR’s Alpha Partners and Core Partners. Available in the sense that BRIDGR’s Alpha Partners and Core Partners should be able to reach out and request for meetings with contacts in a database owned and operated by BRIDGR. For the contacts in the database, this will be a passive source of leads for their respective businesses and offerings.&#x20;

## Who’s the target group?

* BRIDGR’s Alpha Partners and Core Partners will have access to the contact database and meeting request system.

## Who contributes to building this?

* CFJ / MadForNFTs is lead on aggregating contacts&#x20;
* All Alpha Partners should contribute with contacts who have agreed to be in the database and receive meeting requests (do we need a form for the consent?)

## What’s the delivery platform?

* Ideally, the contact database and meeting request system is token gated. We need to ensure that there’s access for partners only.

## Outstanding matters?

* How do we build such a database and meeting request system?&#x20;
  * A: We build a SQL database and a frontend which can filter contacts by expertise/ name/ location. This frontend is Web3 wallet locked on the BRIDGR website. (not sure how to do the meeting request system).
* Are there existing platforms we can use?
* Who builds it?
* How do we pay for it?
