# Increased Visibility

## Why might you need increased visibility?

### 1. Without visibility even the best of products will fail commercially due to a lack of customer acquisition.

### 2. Without visibility you will struggle to retain customers.

### 3. Without visibility you will never build brand value. 

## How BRIDGR helps increase your visibility:

* Our partner Ethlas will integrate your company into one of their cross-community casual games, which will allow you to build connections and gain exposure through friendly competition.&#x20;
* Your company will have its own dedicated channel on BRIDGR’s token gated Discord where you can engage with BRIDGR’s community.&#x20;
* Your company will be featured in one of BRIDGR’s monthly newsletters (one feature included in the annual membership).
* Your company will be featured in a dedicated write-up on BRIDGR’s Medium Blog.
* Your company will be featured in a dedicated AMA session in BRIDGR’s weekly Twitter Spaces.&#x20;
