# Increased Visibility

How do increase visibility?

1. When you join the Friends Bridgr programme you will become part of a network of likeminded companies, projects, and individuals who are passionate about Web3 and have a proven track record of delivering value. Through regular networking sessions you will have the opportunity to share what you are working on and be inspired by others.&#x20;
2. As a Friend of Bridgr you will have exclusive access to Bridgr’s community through sharing session via dedicated Twitter Spaces and/or Discord AMAs.
3. Friends enjoy a featured listing on our website & discord.
4. Friends will be featured in BRIDGR’s monthly newsletter.
5. Friends have dibs on sponsoring WEB3 SOCIAL By Bridgr events. As a sponsor you are featured via the main event banner (digital), dedicated individual banners (digital), and a pitch either by our local event hosts or a representative from your team.
