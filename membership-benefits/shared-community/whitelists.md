# Whitelists

## What’s the general idea?

BRIDGR’s clout allows us to secure WLs. The general idea is to raffle the WLs to verified community members (i.e. community members holding specific tokens or handpicked community members).

## Who’s the target group?

* Verified community members
*
  * Ape Gang Cub holders
  * Ethlas Komo holders
  * Etc….

## Who contributes to building this?

* ?

## What’s the delivery platform?

* Alphabot raffles via BRIDGR’s token gated Discord

## Outstanding matters?

* We need AlphaBot to do the raffles and the subscription fees are 60$ per month. Who pays?
* We need someone to proactively negotiate WLs on behalf of BRIDGR
