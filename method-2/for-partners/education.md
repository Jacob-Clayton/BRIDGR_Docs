# Get a Web3 education

## What’s the general idea?

BRIDGR’s Alpha Partners and combined community have expert Web3 knowledge and knowhow over a wide range of topics. The general idea is to make this knowledge and knowhow available to partners and community members alike.&#x20;

## Who’s the target group?

* BRIDGR’s Alpha Partners and Core Partners
* BRIDGR’s community

## Who contributes to building this?

* Twitter growth strategies for partners (Mark)
* Event planning for partners (Mark)
* Crypto alpha for BRIDGR’s community (Kishor)
* Coding for BRIDGR’s community (Jacob \[Python, SQL] & Jokong\[JS])
* NFTs and crypto for beginners (Hilal & Sima)

## What’s the delivery platform?

* The educational content will be delivered through BRIDGR’s token gated discord
* Each topic will have its own dedicated channel with subchannels
*
  * Guides
  * Q & A
  * \+++

## Outstanding matters?

* We need to put together an overview of the topics we will cover initially
* We need to set deadlines for when the content will be ready
* We need to market the content and start building BRIDGR’s community
