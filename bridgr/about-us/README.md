# About us

## Story

Our founders are passionate about Web3 and the endless possibilities of decentralised online ecosystems powered by blockchain. At the same time, we are saddened whenever we see time, energy, and money being lost to the bad apples of this Space. So, in late 2022 we started BRIDGR, a positive movement of like-minded & well-established Web3 enthusiasts who are here for the right reasons. For a better, genuine and collaborative Web3.
