# Whitepaper

## Web3 companies raised $94 billion from 2016 to 2022 but more than 90% will fail.&#x20;

#### Web3 companies fail for similar reasons as startups in other sectors but the challenges are exacerbated by a fast-paced volatile business environment:

1. No product/market fit
2. Lack of cash / failed to raise new capital
3. Flawed business model
4. Lack of visibility & poor marketing
5. Not the right team
6. Legal problems
